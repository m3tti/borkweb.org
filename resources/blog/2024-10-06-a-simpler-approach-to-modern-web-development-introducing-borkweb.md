# A Simpler Approach to Modern Web Development: Introducing Borkweb
In an era where complexity often masquerades as innovation, Borkweb offers a refreshing alternative. This full-stack framework, built on the foundations of Babashka and Clojure, embodies a modern yet traditional approach to web development, stripping away unnecessary complexity and empowering developers to focus on what matters most – writing high-quality code.

At the core of Borkweb lies the "No Build" philosophy, which champions simplicity, elegance, and efficiency. By eschewing the overhead of bundlers and build steps, Borkweb enables developers to work in a streamlined environment that fosters productivity and creativity.

One of the key advantages of Borkweb is its use of Clojure as the primary language, complemented by Squint for JavaScript and Gaka for CSS. This unified language approach eliminates the need for context switching, allowing developers to maintain a state of flow and focus on crafting exceptional code.

Borkweb's traditional approach to web development is not a rejection of modernity, but rather a thoughtful reevaluation of what truly matters in building great web applications. By embracing simplicity and elegance, Borkweb provides a breath of fresh air in a landscape often dominated by complexity.

The name "Borkweb" is a nod to Michiel Borkent, the visionary behind Babashka and Squint, two integral components of the Borkweb ecosystem. By joining the Borkweb community, developers can be part of a movement that's redefining the way we approach web development – one that values simplicity, elegance, and the joy of coding.

If you're ready to experience the web as it was meant to be, join the Borkweb revolution and discover a more streamlined, more enjoyable approach to modern web development.
