# A Simpler Approach to Modern Web Development: Introducing Borkweb

In a world where complexity often masquerades as sophistication, Borkweb is a breath of fresh air. This full-stack Babashka/Clojure framework is designed to be simple, minimal, and traditional, allowing developers to work efficiently and effectively without getting bogged down in unnecessary configurations and integrations.

At the heart of Borkweb is the "No Build" movement, which prioritizes simplicity, elegance, and getting the job done without unnecessary overhead. This approach is a welcome respite from the complexity that often plagues modern web development.

One of the key benefits of Borkweb is its use of Clojure as the primary language. With Squint providing JavaScript and Gaka handling CSS, developers can work seamlessly in a single language, eliminating the need for context switching and mental overhead. This streamlined approach allows for a state of pure flow, where developers can focus on writing code without distractions.

Borkweb uses the traditional way of doing things in web development, embracing a simplicity and elegance that's often lost in modern tooling and frameworks. By ditching bundlers and build steps, Borkweb allows developers to simply write code and enjoy the outcome.

The name "Borkweb" is a homage to Michiel Borkent, the creator of Babashka and Squint, which are both integral parts of the Borkweb ecosystem. By joining the Borkweb community, developers can be part of a movement that's redefining the way we approach web development.

So why not join the web revolution and experience the web as it was intended? With Borkweb, you can enjoy a simpler, more elegant approach to modern web development.
